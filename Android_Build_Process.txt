Android Build Process is termed as Legacy process as of October 2016.


Working:

Source Codes(.java) + Library Codes(.class) ------------->(Processed Through) Standard javac compiler ------------>Java byte codes(.class)-------->(Proguard- used to minimise and obfuscate the bytecode)Minimized ByteCode(.class)----------->(tool-DEX)------->DEX Bytecode(.dex)

Dex files are the universal files for Android. it is packaged in the application when depolyed on the app store.





Jack Compiler:(Faster than usual)
Source Codes (.java) + Library Codes(.class)-------->(Jack Complier)It converts directly to the DEX Bytecode(.dex)

Jack Compiler does the same work as the Proguard in the Legacy compilation.
